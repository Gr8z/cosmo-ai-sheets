# Cosmo AI Sheets - Excel Clone

A high-performance Excel clone built with Next.js, featuring a virtualized grid with formula support.

## Features

- üöÄ High-performance virtualized grid (10,000 x 10,000 cells)
- üìù Cell editing with formula support
- ‚ûï Basic mathematical operations between cells
- üîÑ Real-time formula recalculation
- ‚å®Ô∏è Full keyboard navigation support (Arrow keys, Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter)
- üìã Copy/paste functionality (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V)
- ‚Ü©Ô∏è Undo/redo support (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z)

## Supported Formulas

Start any formula with `=` to begin calculation mode. Examples:

### Basic Arithmetic

- `=A1 + B1` - Addition
- `=A1 - B1` - Subtraction
- `=A1 * B1` - Multiplication
- `=A1 / B1` - Division
- `=A1 ^ 2` - Exponentiation
- `=(A1 + B1) * C1` - Parentheses for operation order

### Math Functions

- `=sqrt(A1)` - Square root
- `=abs(A1)` - Absolute value
- `=round(A1)` - Round to nearest integer
- `=floor(A1)` - Round down
- `=ceil(A1)` - Round up

### Examples

```
=A1 + B1 * C1         // Basic arithmetic
=sqrt(A1 * 2)         // Function with arithmetic
=abs(A1 - B1)         // Function with cell reference
=round((A1 + B1) / 2) // Nested operations
```

### Error Handling

Formulas will show errors for:

- Circular references (e.g., A1 references B1 which references A1)
- Invalid formulas (syntax errors)
- Division by zero
- Empty cells in formulas are treated as 0 for calculation purposes.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Math.js for formula parsing
- Zustand for state management
- react-window for virtualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling

- Only renders cells currently visible in the viewport
- Maintains smooth scrolling even with 100 million cells
- Optimized header synchronization with transform-based scrolling
- Minimal memory footprint with cell recycling
